What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

# Why I'm doing this 
I decided to improve my codings skills and learn to perform tasks without dependencies/frameworks

# Problems Solved So far
1. ###[Problem 1 - Multiples of 3 and 5](https://github.com/she-WritesCode/ProjectEuler/1-multiples-of-3-and-5)
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
